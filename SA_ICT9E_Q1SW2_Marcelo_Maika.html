			<td colspan="2">Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin, also known as Ibarra, is a Filipino-Spanish descendent of Don Rafael Ibarra, a wealthy Spaniard. He was born and raised in the Philippines, but spent seven years studying in Europe during his adolescence. He was unaware of what was going on in his country throughout those years. When he returned to the Philippines, he discovered that his father had died, and that his body had been transported to a Chinese cemetery (allegedly) (but the body ended up in a river). He had heard stories about how helpful and nice his father was, and he was determined to respect his father's memory by following in his footsteps.</td>

Tya Isabél, Capitán Tiago's cousin, guided and supervised the underprivileged child's development. Since childhood, Mara Clara has been Ibarra's beloved. Capitán Tiago sent María Clara to the Beaterio de Santa Clara while Ibarra was traveling in Europe, where she grew into a charming woman under the strict supervision of the Catholic sisters.</td>

He served as curate for nearly two decades before being succeeded by Padre Salvi, who was significantly younger. Padre Damaso was well-known among the Ibarras, so Crisóstomo was taken aback by what the former curate had done to Don Rafaél.</td>
